# ✅ App Readiness & Security Checklist

This checklist ensures your app is **feature-complete**, **secure**, and **ready for production**. Customize it to fit your project’s needs.

## 📝 Preparation Checklist

### Define the Project

- [ ] Define the app's purpose and target audience.
- [ ] Identify key features and functionality.
- [ ] Document requirements (functional and non-functional).

### Plan the Project

- [ ] Create wireframes or mockups for the UI/UX.
- [ ] Choose the technology stack (front-end, back-end, database, etc.).
- [ ] Plan the project timeline and milestones.
- [ ] Allocate roles and responsibilities for the team.

### Set Up the Environment

- [ ] Set up version control (e.g., Git).
- [ ] Set up the development environment (IDEs, tools, etc.).
- [ ] Research and integrate third-party APIs or services (if needed).
- [ ] Establish coding standards and best practices.
- [ ] Create a risk assessment and mitigation plan.

## 🛠️ Development Checklist

### Project Setup

- [ ] Set up the project structure and initialize the repository.
- [ ] Design and implement the database schema.
- [ ] Create reusable components for the front-end.
- [ ] Implement API endpoints and back-end logic.

### Core Development

- [ ] Implement core features based on requirements.
- [ ] Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
- [ ] Integrate third-party APIs or services.
- [ ] Ensure the app is modular and scalable for future updates.

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) for automated testing.
- [ ] Perform regular code reviews to ensure quality.
- [ ] Document the codebase (comments, README, etc.).

---

## 🧩 Core Functionality

- [ ] All core features implemented and working.
- [ ] UI is responsive across screen sizes.
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive and consistent.
- [ ] Buttons, links, and forms function correctly.
- [ ] Form input validation (front-end & back-end).
- [ ] Meaningful error messages without exposing stack traces.
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) implemented (if applicable).

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing

- [ ] Unit tests written and passing.
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing.

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Manual QA for typical user journeys.
- [ ] Edge case scenarios tested (e.g., empty inputs, timeouts).

### Compatibility Testing

- [ ] Cross-browser and cross-device testing.
- [ ] Accessibility standards (WCAG) verified.

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Load testing and stress testing performed.

---

## 🚀 Performance

- [ ] App load time < 3 seconds.
- [ ] Optimized images (compressed, lazy-loaded).
- [ ] Minified CSS, JS, HTML in production.
- [ ] Caching mechanisms in place.
- [ ] API response times optimized.
- [ ] Lazy-loading non-critical resources (e.g., images, JS modules).

---

## 🔐 Security

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Secure password handling (bcrypt/scrypt/argon2).
- [ ] OAuth2 or secure login implemented.
- [ ] Sessions/tokens expire correctly.
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced.
- [ ] 2FA/MFA implemented (if applicable).

### Data Protection

- [ ] HTTPS (SSL/TLS) enforced.
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted (in transit & at rest).
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or keys in codebase.
- [ ] Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) in place.

### Input Security

- [ ] SQL Injection prevention (parameterized queries).
- [ ] XSS protection (input sanitization and escaping).
- [ ] CSRF protection (anti-CSRF tokens).
- [ ] File upload security (file type, size, scanning).

### Additional Security

- [ ] Regular vulnerability scans (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Snyk).

---

## 🗃️ Server & Database

- [ ] Database access secured by IP and strong credentials.
- [ ] Automated backups configured and tested.
- [ ] Production & development environments isolated.
- [ ] Logging/monitoring in place (no sensitive data in logs).
- [ ] Alerting configured for abnormal activity/errors.
- [ ] Database indexing and query optimization performed.

---

## 📜 Legal & Compliance

- [ ] Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance where applicable.
- [ ] Cookie consent (if using tracking or analytics).
- [ ] Users can delete their account/data (if applicable).
- [ ] Audit logs implemented for compliance tracking.

---

## 🔁 Deployment & Maintenance

### Deployment

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
- [ ] Environment variables managed securely.
- [ ] Staging tested before going live.
- [ ] Rollback strategies implemented for failed deployments.

### Maintenance

- [ ] Dependencies up to date (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.).
- [ ] Security audits scheduled (automated/manual).
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan in place.

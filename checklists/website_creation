# Website Creation Guide

This README provides a structured overview of best practices and steps for creating your own website, especially for beginners. Follow this guide to organize your files, write clean code, and build a maintainable, responsive site.

---

## 1. Project Structure

Organize your project files for clarity and scalability. A typical structure:

```
my-website/
│
├── index.html           # Main HTML file (homepage)
├── about.html           # Example: About page
├── css/
│   └── styles.css       # Main stylesheet
├── js/
│   └── script.js        # Main JavaScript file
├── images/
│   └── logo.png         # Images used in your site
├── README.md            # This guide
└── ...                  # Other assets or pages
```

## 2. HTML Best Practices

- Always start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and use `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Use semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Keep content organized and readable.

---

## 3. CSS Best Practices

- Place all styles in a separate `css/styles.css` file.
- Link your CSS in the `<head>` of your HTML:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
  ```
- Use classes and IDs for styling specific elements.
- Make your site responsive with media queries and the viewport meta tag:
  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  ```

---

## 4. JavaScript Best Practices

- Place scripts in a separate `js/script.js` file.
- Link your JS before the closing `</body>` tag:
  ```html
  <script src="js/script.js"></script>
  ```
- Keep logic modular and avoid mixing JS with HTML when possible.

---

## 5. Images and Assets

- Store images in an `images/` folder.
- Use relative paths for local images:
  ```html
  <img src="images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
  ```
- For online images, use direct URLs. For Google Drive, ensure you have a direct link (not a sharing link).

---

## 6. Version Control

- Use Git to track changes and back up your work.
- Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.

---

## 7. Documentation

- Keep this `README.md` updated with instructions and project details.
- Document any setup steps, dependencies, or special instructions.

---

## 8. Going Live

- To share your site online, use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- Make sure all assets (images, CSS, JS) are uploaded with your site.

---

## 9. Accessibility & SEO

- Use alt text for images.
- Use proper heading structure (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
- Add a `<title>` and meta description in the `<head>`.

---

## 10. Example: Minimal HTML File

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>This is a sample landing page.</p>
      <img src="images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
    </main>
    <script src="js/script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
